This is a repository for Module 3 homework. <br>
The purpose of this code is to read the CSV files contained within the repository and analyze them with Python. <br>

I collaborated with classmates Kiet Hoan, Kyle Tener, Michael Pointek, Katie Ballinger, Michael Nurthen, Mia Hursh, Victoria Ro, Chau Nguyen, Julius Bzozowski, and Jordan Mayville on this assignment.
